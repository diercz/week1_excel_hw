Analysis of Kickstarter dataset to assist Louise in understanding the trends of successful campaigns.
## Overiew of Project
Louise is looking to analyze how different campaigns fared in their funding goals in relation to their launch dates after she was able to come close her fundraising goal in a short amount of time.  From the data received for the project I analyzed the length of the kickstarter campaigns, percentage of their goal funded, and the success rates based on year.  

Within the excel report, images and analysis below we will discuss the analysis completed, the shortcomings Louise had, and challenges we faced with the data.
## Analysis and Challenges
Within the analysis I found that Louise's play, Fever, reached 86% of their fundraising goal in twenty-eight days, while the average Kickstarter campaign for plays was about 31 days.  The average donation for Louise's play was $248.50 and averaged $88.75 per day in donations received. If Louise was able to keep her Kickstarter campaing open for four more days, based on her average per day donation she would have reached her goal.  

Within our analysis, we completed a pivot table and line chart by month of campaign start date and split this by number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns.  The highest success rates for play campaigns occured in the months of May and June, which is when Louise conducted her Kickstarter campaign.  Louise's campaign goal was $2885.00.  Based on our analysis, for campaigns between $1000.00 and $4999.00 the success rate was 72.66%.

I did not run into any challenges when completing the analysis for the project, but some challenges that some may run into when completing the analysis would be to make sure your "number type" is in the correct format for the column you are trying to analyze.  Also, when entering in a formula, make sure you do not have any unnecessary filters on and that you are entering in the correct cell for the formula.
## Results
### Based on Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
Based on the table I put together I found that 25% of all Theater campaigns are started in May and June.  Even though these two months have the highest number of failed campaigns, due to the amount of total campaigns, these two months also have the highest success rates of all months.
### Based on Outcomes Based on Goals
The highest percentage of Kickstarter campaigns that were successful had campaign goals less than $5,000.00.  They success rates of the campaigns signicantly declined as the goal's dollar figure climbed.  A couple outliers would be the the $35,000 to $45,000, but the amount of total projects were also significantly less for these campaigns as well.  
### Limitations
There were limitations to the dataset that I received that would have allowed us to get a clearer picure into why Louise's campaigned failed to reach her goal.  Within the data set we were unable to determin the dollar amount of donations by day.  This data set were were only provided total dollar amount received and the date span of the campaign.  It would have been interesting to see if Louise's campaign started out strong and each day she received less and less or why she decided to have her campaign run for only twenty-eight days.  

Other graphs that would have beneficial to have that would have given us other visuals for the project is a bar graph based on "plays" vs "Theatre" as whole to only focus on plays.
